# Deploying Cooke to a repository

1. Download the latest release
2. Extract that file to %REPOSITORY-NAME%/Cooke/
3. Open a terminal in %REPOSITORY-NAME%/Cooke/
4. Type `cooke`

The first time you execute Cooke, it will build a default configuration file, and then exit.

Before using Cooke again, review the %REPOSITORY-NAME%/Cooke/cooke-config.json file.
